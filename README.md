# Tableau
## Tableau Projects Overview
In this section, I demonstrate my expertise in Tableau through various data visualization projects that highlight my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights. Each project showcases different Tableau features and skills that are essential for data analysis and storytelling.
## Key Skills Highlighted:
- **Data Connection & Preparation:** Experience connecting Tableau to multiple data sources, including **Excel** and **SQL databases**. Proficient in data cleansing, filtering, and reshaping using Tableau’s data preparation tools.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Created dynamic and interactive dashboards with drill-down capabilities, allowing users to explore data at multiple levels. Implemented **dual-axis charts**, **synchronized axes**, and used **parameters** for dynamic filtering and user-controlled input.
- **Table Calculations:** Applied custom table calculations to track metrics such as **year-over-year growth**, **running totals**, and **cumulative sums**, ensuring accurate trend analysis over time.
- **Advanced Visualizations:** Developed various advanced visualizations including **heat maps**, **scatter plots**, **bar charts**, **line graphs**, and **dual-axis charts**. Integrated calculated fields to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and used conditional formatting for emphasis.
- **Tooltips & Conditional Indicators:** Enhanced user experience by adding tooltips with conditional indicators. For example, included indicators to show when 2024 Sales > 2023 Sales, making the analysis more insightful at a glance.
- **Layout Design:** Utilized Tableau’s layout containers (vertical and horizontal containers) for creating clean and organized dashboard designs. Customized background, padding, and borders for an aesthetically pleasing and functional layout.
